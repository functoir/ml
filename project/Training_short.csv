the worst part is the customer service.  they only warranty this product for 90 days!!!  no matter what you find online, the warranty is 90 days!!  i filed a complaint with the department of consumer protection and trade due to false advertising.  when i bought it, it was advertised with a lifetime warranty.  the customer service of the company, especially jim, are not helpful and don't even know their products.  i sent him pictures of mine, model numbers, receipts, etc, and he told me story after story but never fixed anything.  i was told the lock was a easy-to-fix $12 part.  yet suddenly this part doesn't fit my hitch!  i was told the locks have a lifetime warranty -- well they don't.  i was told they would give me a great deal on a new model for my trouble -- then they told me amazon has better prices than their ""great deal"".

i will never buy a trimax product again, not because the product fails and is of poor quality, but because of their terrible customer service!",Terrible Product - Worse Company,1509321600,3,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NjHfX8NVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uj+eoXwKL._SY88.jpg']",,automotive
